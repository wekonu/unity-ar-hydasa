usb debugging must be enabled on your device (your phone). see the option on Settings>System>Developer Option
(maybe different on your device. search on google for where is Developer Option on your device)
if you cant find developer option the you must unlock it first. theres plenty article on google. put your fingers on some work!

adb is also required for the script to run.
adb is part of android platform-tools, usually you can find it in android sdk folder

to test if you can access adb on your pc, try to type 'adb' (without quotes) on command prompt then press enter

if it says that adb is not part of any command then put path to adb on your environtment variable path

search on google or youtube if you dont understand what I mean! dont be lazy!
